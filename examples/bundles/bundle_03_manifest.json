The employer has implemented reasonable adjustments under the Equality Act 2010: visual alarm beacons, high-contrast tactile wayfinding, and a buddy system. The PEEP was reviewed at 6 months (rather than annually) due to a role change. The review resulted in an amended PEEP for the new floor location with a new buddy assignment. This demonstrates responsive review cycles triggered by change of circumstance."
