## For Technical Stakeholders

## Purpose

**From April 2026**, the Fire Safety (Residential Evacuation Plans) (England) Regulations 2025 require responsible persons to:

1. **Assess** evacuation capability of relevant residents
2. **Create** Personal Emergency Evacuation Plans (PEEPs)
3. **Obtain consent** for information sharing
4. **Share** PEEPs with Fire & Rescue Services
5. **Review** plans annually

**The regulations tell you WHAT to do.**  
**OpenPEEP tells you HOW to structure and share this information digitally.**

This standard provides the technical specification for creating, storing, and exchanging PEEP information in a consistent, interoperable format.

---

## Scope

OpenPEEP defines data structures for:

- **PCFRA** (Person-Centred Fire Risk Assessment) — evacuation capability and environmental risk
- **PEEP** (Personal Emergency Evacuation Plan) — the evacuation procedure
- **Consent** — legal record of consent decisions (given, refused, withdrawn)
- **Review** — periodic review tracking
- **EES** (Emergency Evacuation Statement) — plain-language resident instructions

**Application contexts:**
- Residential buildings (high-rise, sheltered housing, care homes)
- Workplaces (Fire Safety Order 2005, Equality Act 2010)
- Healthcare facilities (hospitals, residential care)
- Public buildings (universities, hotels, transport hubs)

**Jurisdiction:**
- UK-origin (compliant with Residential Regs 2025, FSO 2005, BSA 2022)
- Internationally portable (ISO-aligned, extensible for any jurisdiction)

---

## Why a Standard Format Matters

### **The Problem**

After the Grenfell Tower tragedy (72 deaths), it became clear that:

❌ **Fragmented data** — Every organization creates PEEPs differently (Word docs, PDFs, proprietary databases)  
❌ **No interoperability** — Fire Services receive information in 10+ different formats  
❌ **Data doesn't travel** — Resident moves building → PEEP doesn't follow  
❌ **No digital sharing** — Regulations require sharing with FRS, but no standard format exists  
❌ **Reinventing the wheel** — 170 local authorities creating bespoke solutions  

### **The Solution**

✅ **One standard format** — Everyone structures PEEP data the same way  
✅ **Interoperable** — Systems can exchange information seamlessly  
✅ **Portable** — Person moves → data travels with them  
✅ **Machine-readable** — Fire Services can integrate into operational systems  
✅ **Compliant** — Aligns with UK regulations, GDPR, international standards  

**OpenPEEP provides the specification.** Like BS 7671 for electrical wiring or Approved Document B for fire safety design, OpenPEEP defines how to structure digital PEEP information correctly.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. **Standards-Based**

OpenPEEP aligns with established international standards:

- **ISO 8601 / RFC 3339** — Date and time formats (UTC with timezone offset)
- **ISO 3166-1 alpha-2** — Country codes
- **ISO 3166-2** — Subdivision codes (UK nations, US states, etc.)
- **ISO 639-1/2** — Language codes
- **ISO 19160** — Addressing concepts (international portability)
- **JSON Schema Draft 2020-12** — Technical validation specification
- **WCAG 2.2** — Accessible documentation principles

### 2. **Privacy-by-Design**

**Data minimisation:**
- ❌ Do NOT record medical diagnoses ("has Parkinson's disease")
- ✅ DO record functional capability ("uses wheelchair; cannot use stairs")

**GDPR compliant:**
- Consent tracking (legal record of decisions)
- Clear data retention guidance
- Purpose limitation (evacuation planning only)
- Data subject rights (access, rectification, erasure)

### 3. **Separation of Concerns**

**PCFRA** = Assessment outputs (capability, risks, needs)  
**PEEP** = The plan (routes, assistance, procedure)  
**Consent** = Legal record (standalone, auditable)  
**Review** = Version control (annual reviews, supersession)  
**EES** = Plain-language instructions (for residents)

Each serves a distinct purpose. Link them via references (UUIDs).

### 4. **Core + Extensions Pattern**

**This is what makes OpenPEEP universally adoptable.**

**Core schema** = Portable, universal fields (works everywhere)  
**Extensions** = Jurisdiction-specific or organizational fields (your custom data)

**Example:**

```json
{
  "id": "peep-a1b2c3d4",
  "personRef": "person-xyz",
  "addressRef": "address-abc",
  "routes": [
    {
      "type": "primary",
      "description": "Via lift to assembly point..."
    }
  ],
  "extensions": {
    "gbr": {
      "relevantResident": true
    },
    "yourOrganization": {
      "tenantId": "TENANT-12345",
      "propertyCode": "CH-12A"
    }
  }
}
```

**Core travels everywhere. Extensions stay local.**

**See:** [Extensions Guide](docs/extensions_guide.md) for comprehensive explanation.

## Technical Specification

### **Format**

OpenPEEP uses **JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation) as the data interchange format.

**Why JSON?**
- ✅ Human-readable (text-based)
- ✅ Machine-readable (structured)
- ✅ Universal support (every programming language)
- ✅ Well-defined validation (JSON Schema)
- ✅ Lightweight (efficient transmission)

### **Schema Language**

Schemas are defined in **JSON Schema Draft 2020-12**.

**Each schema includes:**
- `$schema` — JSON Schema version
- `$id` — Stable URI for this schema version
- `title` — Human-readable name
- `description` — Purpose and use
- `type` — Data type (object, array, string, etc.)
- `properties` — Field definitions
- `required` — Mandatory fields (minimal)
- `additionalProperties` — Extensibility policy (explicit)
- `examples` — Sample data

### **Naming Conventions**

- **Properties:** camelCase (`personRef`, `evacRoutes`, `createdAt`)
- **Dates:** ISO 8601 / RFC 3339 (`2025-10-14T09:30:00Z`)
- **Identifiers:** UUID v4 format (`a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890`)
- **Countries:** ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 (`GB`, `US`, `FR`)
- **Languages:** ISO 639-1 (`en`, `cy`, `gd`)

### **Extensibility**

Every schema includes an `extensions` object:

```json
{
  "extensions": {
    "gbr": { ... },          // UK-specific fields
    "eu": { ... },           // EU-specific fields
    "usa": { ... },          // US-specific fields
    "yourOrganization": { ... }  // Your custom fields
  }
}
```

**Core schema is immutable.** Extensions add jurisdiction or organizational data without breaking interoperability.

**See:** [Extensions Guide](docs/extensions_guide.md) for comprehensive explanation.

---

## Real-World Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Fire Service Pre-Planning**

**Context:**  
Anytown Fire & Rescue Service covers 50 high-rise residential buildings across 8 housing providers.

**Without OpenPEEP:**
- ❌ Receives PEEPs in 8 different formats (Word, PDF, CSV, proprietary databases)
- ❌ Cannot integrate into operational systems
- ❌ Manual lookup during incident (delays, errors)

**With OpenPEEP:**
- ✅ All 8 housing providers send PEEPs in OpenPEEP format
- ✅ FRS imports into one database (machine-readable)
- ✅ Operational firefighters access structured data (who needs help, where, what equipment)
- ✅ Pre-planning enabled (know building context before attending)

**Outcome:** 2-5 minutes saved per incident. Standardized information improves safety.

---

### **Scenario 2: Resident Transfer**

**Context:**  
Elderly resident moves from Council Housing (Tower A) to Care Home (Tower B).

**Without OpenPEEP:**
- ❌ Council Housing has PEEP in proprietary system
- ❌ Care Home uses different system
- ❌ Data doesn't transfer → care home starts from scratch
- ❌ Risk of information loss (previous mobility assessment, equipment needs)

**With OpenPEEP:**
- ✅ Council Housing exports PEEP in OpenPEEP format
- ✅ Care Home imports (standard format)
- ✅ Core data available immediately (evacuation capability, equipment)
- ✅ Care Home adds own extensions (care level, medication location)

**Outcome:** Data continuity. Resident safety maintained during transition.

---

### **Scenario 3: Multi-Site Organization**

**Context:**  
National care home provider operates 50 sites across England, Scotland, Wales.

**Challenge:**
- Different fire safety regulations (England, Scotland, Wales)
- Different local authority requirements
- Need consistency across sites + local compliance

**OpenPEEP solution:**
- ✅ Core schema used everywhere (consistency)
- ✅ England sites add `extensions.gbr` (Residential Regs 2025 fields)
- ✅ Scotland sites add `extensions.sct` (Scottish-specific requirements)
- ✅ Wales sites add `extensions.cym` (Welsh language, local requirements)
- ✅ Organization adds `extensions.companyName` (internal tenant IDs, care levels)

**Outcome:** One system, multiple jurisdictions. Core remains portable.

---

### **Scenario 4: Workplace to Residential**

**Context:**  
Employee has PEEP at workplace (uses wheelchair, requires refuge area). Same person is resident in social housing (high-rise flat).

**Without OpenPEEP:**
- ❌ Two separate PEEPs in different formats
- ❌ No connection or consistency
- ❌ Duplication of assessment effort

**With OpenPEEP:**
- ✅ Both PEEPs in same format
- ✅ Core capability data consistent (uses wheelchair, cannot use stairs)
- ✅ Context-specific extensions (workplace: buddy system; residential: FRS sharing)
- ✅ Person carries PEEP between contexts

**Outcome:** Unified approach. Efficiency. Consistency.

---
