# What is OpenPEEP?

**OpenPEEP** is both a practical **how-to guide** and a detailed **technical specification** for creating, sharing, and maintaining **Personal Emergency Evacuation Plans (PEEPs)** and related safety documents.

In short — it is **the missing link between knowing what to do and actually doing it**.

For years, everyone in the fire safety world — from housing providers and councils to care homes and Fire & Rescue Services — has known *what* needs to happen: people need clear, accurate, and shareable **Personal Emergency Evacuation Plans (PEEPs)**.

The problem was never the *what*; the problem was the *how* — how to do it properly, consistently, and digitally.

That’s what **OpenPEEP** will standardise.

## Why OpenPEEP Needed to Exist (and Why Now)

From April 2026, evacuation information must be shared digitally with Fire & Rescue Services. In that world, PDFs, Word documents, email attachments, spreadsheet rows, and data locked in proprietary systems are not fit for purpose. They can’t be validated reliably, are hard to keep current, and are brittle to integrate at scale.

Without a shared framework, every organisation has been — or soon will be — forced to invent its own solution: similar in spirit, incompatible in practice. Fire services spend hours converting data. Housing providers duplicate effort. Consultants produce excellent assessments that can’t plug into anything else. It’s chaotic, inefficient, and expensive — and it erodes accountability.

**OpenPEEP** provides a single, open, regulation-aligned framework so the whole sector can speak the same digital language — safely, transparently, and without vendor lock-in.

## The Legislation Told Us *What* to Do — But Never *How*

Fire safety legislation has always been clear about the *what*.  
Over the years, it has evolved, refined, and expanded — from the **Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005** through to the **Fire Safety (Residential Evacuation Plans) (England) Regulations 2025**.

It tells us what must exist: assessments, plans, responsibilities, and records.  
But it never tells us *how* to make them work in practice.

It never says:  
“Start here. Finish there. Here’s how your plan should be structured, validated, and shared.”  

That gap — the *how* — has always been left open to interpretation.  
Understandable, perhaps, but it’s led to decades of inconsistency, duplication, and confusion across the sector.

**OpenPEEP** is the community’s answer to that problem.  
It’s a shared framework that finally locks in the *how* — turning the intent of legislation into something everyone can use, understand, and build upon together.

## Built on the Law — Not Around It

OpenPEEP was designed from the ground up to align with every major UK fire safety regulation and guidance document.

### Regulatory Alignment

- **Fire Safety (Residential Evacuation Plans) (England) Regulations 2025** – mandates digital PEEPs from April 2026.  
- **Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005** – defines the duties of the Responsible Person.  
- **Fire Safety Act 2021 / 2022** – clarifies the application of the Fire Safety Order to external walls and flat entrance doors.  
- **Building Safety Act 2022** – introduces the *golden thread* of safety information.  
- **Equality Act 2010** – enshrines the duty to make reasonable adjustments for disabled people.  
- **Approved Document B (Fire Safety)** – provides statutory guidance on means of escape, refuges, and evacuation lifts.  
- **NFCC Person-Centred Fire Risk Framework (2023)** – defines best practice for person-centred fire risk assessment.  
- **BS 9991 / BS 9999 / BS 7974 / BS EN 81-76** – supporting standards for design and evacuation-lift operation.

These are not footnotes; they are the foundation. OpenPEEP makes the law **usable, interoperable, and auditable**.

## The Complete End-to-End Framework

OpenPEEP defines the **entire lifecycle** of evacuation planning — from initial assessment through to digital sharing and review.

### 1. Person-Centred Fire Risk Assessment (PCFRA)
- Environmental and individual risk evaluation  
- Identification of support needs and control measures  
- Fully aligned with NFCC and Equality Act guidance  

### 2. PEEP Creation and Management
- Standardised digital structure and validation  
- Individual procedures generated from assessment data  
- Multi-agency coordination and audit readiness  

### 3. Distribution and Sharing
- Resident-facing *Emergency Evacuation Statements (EES)*  
- Secure digital exchange with Fire & Rescue  
- Consent and data protection handled by design  

### 4. Review and Maintenance
- Version control, validation, and compliance monitoring  
- Continuous improvement through standardised review cycles  

OpenPEEP is **not software**. It’s a **shared system of language and logic** that any organisation or platform can use to ensure information moves smoothly between people, systems, and services.

## Why It Matters

With one open standard:
- Fire & Rescue Services receive data in the same format from every provider — no rekeying, no ad-hoc conversions.  
- Housing associations and care groups reduce duplication and error.  
- Consultants deliver assessments that are instantly compatible.  
- Regulators can verify compliance efficiently.  

This is how we move from confusion to consistency — from compliance risk to compliance confidence.

## OpenPEEP Is for Everyone

**For Housing Providers**  
Create, validate, and share digital PEEPs at scale, using the same schema as every other compliant organisation.  

**For Fire & Rescue Services**  
Receive and process PEEPs instantly — no format conversion, no manual data handling.  

**For Care Providers**  
Produce accessible, person-centred evacuation plans that meet both legal and ethical standards.  

**For Local Authorities**  
Coordinate compliance across departments and partners using a shared, transparent framework.  

**For Developers & Integrators**  
Build once, integrate everywhere. OpenPEEP is schema-driven, open source, and freely available.  

**For Consultants**  
Deliver professional, consistent, regulation-aligned outputs — every time.

## Open, Independent, and Free

OpenPEEP is completely **independent of any commercial platform**.  
It’s not a product, not an upsell, and not tied to any specific system.  

It’s a **benevolent, open contribution to the sector** — a framework designed to make compliance achievable, affordable, and fair.  

- **Open Source** – Licensed under MIT / CC BY.  
- **Transparent Governance** – Developed in public, by and for practitioners.  
- **No Vendor Lock-In** – Implement on any platform, anywhere.  
- **Evolving Standard** – Updates in line with legislation and best practice.  
- **Public Good** – Created to serve the sector, not to profit from it.

## A Shared Future

From April 2026, digital evacuation planning becomes mandatory.  
If everyone adopts the same open framework, duplication is removed, cost is reduced, and — most importantly — safety is improved for everyone.

OpenPEEP gives the UK a single, trusted foundation for evacuation planning.  
If everyone supports it, a consistent, transparent, and properly modern fire-safety ecosystem is created.

Let’s make digital fire safety **proper** — open, consistent, and future-ready.
