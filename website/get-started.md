## Understanding OpenPEEP

OpenPEEP is **not software** — it is a **shared system of language and logic** that enables consistent, compliant evacuation planning across organisations and platforms.

Think of it as the **digital blueprint** that ensures everyone speaks the same language when creating, sharing, and managing Personal Emergency Evacuation Plans.

### Why OpenPEEP Exists

From April 2026, the Fire Safety (Residential Evacuation Plans) (England) Regulations 2025 mandate that responsible persons must create and digitally share PEEPs. 

The legislation tells us **what** must be done, but not **how** to do it consistently across thousands of organisations.

OpenPEEP fills that gap by providing:
- **Standardised structure** for evacuation plans
- **Clear data formats** for digital sharing
- **Compliance framework** aligned with UK regulations
- **Interoperability** between different systems and agencies

---

## The Complete Workflow

OpenPEEP defines the **entire lifecycle** of evacuation planning — from initial assessment through to digital sharing and ongoing review.

### 1. Person-Centred Fire Risk Assessment (PCFRA)

**What it is:** A comprehensive evaluation of both the person and their environment to identify evacuation needs and risks.

**What it covers:**
- Individual capabilities and support requirements
- Environmental factors (building layout, access routes, equipment)
- Risk identification and mitigation strategies
- Equality Act compliance for reasonable adjustments

**Why it matters:** The PCFRA forms the foundation for everything that follows. It is the "assessment" that feeds into the "plan."

### 2. PEEP Creation and Management

**What it is:** The actual evacuation plan created from PCFRA data, structured in a standardised digital format.

**What it contains:**
- Individual evacuation procedures
- Support requirements and equipment needs
- Emergency contacts and coordination protocols
- Validation and compliance flags

**Why it matters:** This is the document that fire services, care providers, and emergency responders will use during an actual emergency.

### 3. Distribution and Sharing

**What it is:** The secure digital exchange of evacuation information between relevant parties.

**What it involves:**
- **Emergency Evacuation Statements (EES)** — resident-facing summaries
- **Digital sharing** with Fire & Rescue Services
- **Consent management** and data protection compliance
- **Multi-agency coordination** protocols

**Why it matters:** Information must reach the right people at the right time, in a format they can immediately understand and act upon.

### 4. Review and Maintenance

**What it is:** Ongoing management to ensure plans remain accurate, valid, and compliant.

**What it includes:**
- Regular plan updates and validation
- Compliance monitoring and reporting
- Continuous improvement through standardised review cycles
- Version control and audit trails

**Why it matters:** Evacuation plans are living documents that must evolve with changing circumstances, regulations, and best practices.

## What Are Schemas?

A **schema** is essentially a **digital template** that defines how information should be structured and organised.

### Think of it Like a Form

Imagine you're filling out a job application. The application form has:
- **Specific fields** (name, address, qualifications)
- **Required information** (some fields must be completed)
- **Format requirements** (dates in DD/MM/YYYY format)
- **Validation rules** (email addresses must be valid)

A schema works the same way, but for digital evacuation plans.

### Why Schemas Matter

**Without schemas:** Every organisation creates evacuation plans differently. Fire services receive inconsistent data. Information gets lost or misinterpreted.

**With OpenPEEP schemas:** Everyone uses the same structure. Information flows seamlessly between systems. Compliance is built-in and verifiable.

### OpenPEEP Schemas Cover:

- **PCFRA Schema** — How to structure fire risk assessments
- **PEEP Schema** — How to format evacuation plans
- **Emergency Evacuation Statement Schema** — How to create resident-facing statements
- **Consent Schema** — How to manage consent and data protection
- **Review Schema** — How to track updates and compliance

---

## The Consent and Review Process

### Why Consent Matters

Creating evacuation plans involves personal information — health conditions, mobility needs, support requirements. This data is sensitive and protected under GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018.

**Consent is not optional** — it is a legal requirement that protects both the individual and the organisation.

### The OpenPEEP Consent Framework

**What it includes:**
- Clear consent capture and management
- Data minimisation (collecting only what's necessary)
- Purpose limitation (using data only for evacuation planning)
- Retention policies (how long data is kept)
- Individual rights (access, correction, deletion)

**Why it's built-in:** OpenPEEP schemas include consent fields and validation rules, ensuring compliance is designed-in rather than bolted-on.

### The Review Process

Evacuation plans must be reviewed regularly because:
- **Individual needs change** (health, mobility, support requirements)
- **Building conditions change** (refurbishments, new equipment, access modifications)
- **Regulations evolve** (new requirements, updated guidance)
- **Best practices improve** (lessons learned, new technologies)

**OpenPEEP provides:** Standardised review cycles, version control, and compliance tracking to ensure plans remain current and valid.
