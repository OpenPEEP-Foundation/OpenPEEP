## What This Document Provides

This traditional PCFRA (Environment) template shows what information should be included in a complete Environmental Fire Risk Assessment - the assessment of environmental factors that affect evacuation capability and safety.

**For digital systems:** Use the [OpenPEEP PCFRA Environment schema](../schemas/pcfra.environment.schema.json) to structure this information in a standardized, machine-readable format.

**For manual PCFRA:** Use this template as a comprehensive checklist to ensure nothing is missed.

**For validation:** This template validates that our OpenPEEP schemas cover all real-world environmental PCFRA requirements.
