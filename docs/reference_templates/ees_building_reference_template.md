# Emergency Evacuation Statement (Building) – Reference Template

**Purpose:** Human-readable checklist for creating complete Building Emergency Evacuation Statements  
**Audience:** Building managers, fire safety officers, local authority staff, care providers  
**Note:** For digital implementation, use [OpenPEEP schemas](../schemas/ees_building.schema.json) instead

## What This Document Provides

This traditional EES (Building) template shows what information should be included in a complete Building Emergency Evacuation Statement - the building-specific evacuation guidance and procedures.

**For digital systems:** Use the [OpenPEEP EES Building schema](../schemas/ees_building.schema.json) to structure this information in a standardized, machine-readable format.

**For manual EES:** Use this template as a comprehensive checklist to ensure nothing is missed.

**For validation:** This template validates that our OpenPEEP schemas cover all real-world building EES requirements.
