# PEEP Reference Template

**Purpose:** Human-readable checklist for creating complete PEEPs  
**Audience:** Housing officers, care staff, fire safety assessors, local authority staff  
**Note:** For digital implementation, use [OpenPEEP schemas](../schemas/) instead

## What This Document Provides

This traditional PEEP template shows what information should be included in a complete Personal Emergency Evacuation Plan.

**For digital systems:** Use the [OpenPEEP schemas](../schemas/) to structure this information in a standardized, machine-readable format.

**For manual PEEPs:** Use this template as a comprehensive checklist to ensure nothing is missed.

**For validation:** This template validates that our OpenPEEP schemas cover all real-world PEEP requirements.
