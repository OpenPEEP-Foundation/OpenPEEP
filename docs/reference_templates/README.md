## Template vs Example

### Reference Templates
- **Purpose:** Comprehensive checklist of what to include
- **Format:** Structured sections with guidance
- **Use:** Planning, assessment, quality assurance
- **Audience:** Assessors, developers, quality managers

### Complete Examples
- **Purpose:** Realistic, finished documents with sample data
- **Format:** Fully completed documents with realistic content
- **Use:** Training, validation, implementation guidance
- **Audience:** Assessors, developers, stakeholders

## OpenPEEP Integration

### Schema Mapping
Each template shows how traditional document sections map to OpenPEEP schemas:
- **Template section** → **OpenPEEP schema field**
- **Purpose explanation** for each mapping
- **Validation confirmation** that schemas cover all requirements

### Digital Implementation
- Use [OpenPEEP schemas](../../schemas/) for structured data
- Validate using [validator tool](../../tools/viewer/)
- Reference [JSON examples](../../examples/) for implementation

### Manual to Digital Bridge
- **Templates** show what goes in documents (content)
- **OpenPEEP schemas** show how to structure that content (format)
- **Examples** show what finished documents look like (output)
