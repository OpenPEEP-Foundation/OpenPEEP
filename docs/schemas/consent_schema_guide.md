## Overview

### What is Consent?

A **Consent** record is a **standalone, legally auditable record** of whether a person has:
- ‚úÖ **Given** consent for evacuation planning
- ‚ùå **Refused** consent
- üîÑ **Withdrawn** previously given consent

Think of it as a **legal receipt** that proves:
- You **offered** consent (with date/time)
- The person **decided** (given/refused/withdrawn)
- You **recorded** it properly (who, when, how)
- What the consent **covers** (PCFRA, PEEP, sharing with FRS, etc.)

### Why Does Consent Matter?

**Legal requirements:**
- üá¨üáß **UK Residential Regs 2025 (Reg 4):** Must offer and record consent for RPEEPs
- üá™üá∫ **UK GDPR Article 6:** Consent is a lawful basis for processing personal data
- üåç **Equality Act 2010:** Can't force someone to disclose disability

**Practical reasons:**
- **Respect autonomy** - people have the right to refuse
- **Audit trail** - prove you offered consent
- **Legal protection** - evidence of compliance
- **Data rights** - basis for data processing

### Key Principle

Consent is **NOT an access control model**.  
It's a **record of decision**, not a permission system.

What it does:
- ‚úÖ Records: "Did person agree to PEEP creation?"
- ‚úÖ Records: "Can we share PEEP with FRS?"

What it doesn't do:
- ‚ùå Control who can view the PEEP
- ‚ùå Define user permissions
- ‚ùå Manage system access

## Quick Start

### Minimal Consent (Given)

```json
{
  "state": "given",
  "capturedAt": "2025-10-14T10:00:00Z",
  "capturedBy": "housing.officer@example.org",
  "scope": ["pcfra", "peep"]
}

  "scope": ["pcfra", "peep", "rpeep"]
}
```

**This records:**
- ‚ùå Consent was **refused**

## Complete Field Reference

### Required Fields

#### `state`

**Type:** String (enum)  
**Required:** ‚úÖ Yes  
**Allowed values:** `"given"`, `"refused"`, `"withdrawn"`

**What it is:**  
The outcome of the consent decision.

**How to use it:**

**`"given"`** - Person consented:
```json
"state": "given"
```
Use when: Person says yes, signs form, ticks box.

**`"refused"`** - Person declined:
```json
"state": "refused"
```
Use when: Person says no, declines to participate.

**`"withdrawn"`** - Person revoked previous consent:
```json
"state": "withdrawn"
```
Use when: Person previously gave consent, now wants it cancelled.

**Common mistakes:**
- ‚ùå Using `"accepted"`, `"denied"`, `"revoked"` (not in enum)
- ‚ùå Using `null` or empty string
- ‚úÖ Use exact strings: `"given"`, `"refused"`, `"withdrawn"`

**Legal significance:**
- **Given:** Proceed with PEEP/PCFRA
- **Refused:** Cannot proceed; must record offer and refusal
- **Withdrawn:** Must stop processing (unless other lawful basis exists)

---

#### `capturedAt`

**Type:** String (ISO 8601 date-time)  
**Required:** ‚úÖ Yes  
**Example:** `"2025-10-14T10:30:00Z"`

**What it is:**  
The exact date and time the consent decision was recorded.

**Why it exists:**  
Legal auditability. Proves when consent was given/refused/withdrawn.

**How to use it:**  
Use ISO 8601 format with timezone:

**UTC (recommended):**
```json
"capturedAt": "2025-10-14T10:30:00Z"
```
The `Z` means UTC (Coordinated Universal Time).

**With timezone offset:**
```json
"capturedAt": "2025-10-14T10:30:00+01:00"
```
UK summer time (BST = UTC+1).

```json
"capturedAt": "2025-10-14T10:30:00-05:00"
```
US Eastern Standard Time (EST = UTC-5).

**How to generate:**
```javascript
// JavaScript
new Date().toISOString()
// "2025-10-14T10:30:00.123Z"

// Python
from datetime import datetime, timezone
datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat()
# "2025-10-14T10:30:00.123456+00:00"

// Command line (Mac/Linux)
date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"
# "2025-10-14T10:30:00Z"
```

**Common mistakes:**
- ‚ùå Local time without timezone: `"2025-10-14T10:30:00"` (ambiguous!)
- ‚ùå Date only: `"2025-10-14"` (missing time)
- ‚ùå Non-ISO format: `"14/10/2025 10:30"` (wrong format)
- ‚úÖ Always use ISO 8601 with timezone (prefer UTC)

**Legal significance:**  
If consent is disputed, this timestamp proves when decision was made.

---

#### `capturedBy`

**Type:** String  
**Required:** ‚úÖ Yes  
**Example:** `"housing.officer@example.org"`

**What it is:**  
Identifier of the person or system that recorded the consent decision.

**Why it exists:**  
Accountability. Who recorded this? Who can verify it?

**How to use it:**  
Can be:
- **Email address:** `"housing.officer@example.org"`
- **User ID:** `"user-12345"`
- **Name + role:** `"Jordan Smith, Housing Officer"`
- **System:** `"automated-system@example.org"`

**Best practice:**  
Use a format you can trace back:
- ‚úÖ Email address (can contact them)
- ‚úÖ User ID (can look up in your system)
- ‚ùå Just a name (which "John Smith"?)

**Common mistakes:**
- ‚ùå Empty string or generic: `"admin"`, `"system"`
- ‚ùå Just first name: `"Jordan"`
- ‚úÖ Specific, traceable identifier

**Legal significance:**  
If consent is audited, you need to know who recorded it.

---

#### `scope`

**Type:** Array of strings (enum)  
**Required:** ‚úÖ Yes (minimum 1 item)  
**Allowed values:**
- `"pcfra"` - Person-Centred Fire Risk Assessment
- `"peep"` - Personal Emergency Evacuation Plan
- `"rpeep"` - Residential PEEP (UK Residential Regs 2025)
- `"ees_person_statement"` - EES Personal (plain-language instructions)
- `"share_with_frs"` - Share PEEP with Fire and Rescue Service

**What it is:**  
What does this consent cover? What are they agreeing/refusing?

**Why it exists:**  
Purpose limitation (UK GDPR Article 5(1)(b)). Consent must be **specific**.

Can't say: "Consent for everything"  
Must say: "Consent for PCFRA and PEEP"

**How to use it:**

**Single purpose:**
```json
"scope": ["pcfra"]
```
Consent only for PCFRA (assessment).

**Multiple purposes:**
```json
"scope": ["pcfra", "peep", "rpeep"]
```
Consent for assessment and plan.

**Full residential scope (UK RPEEP):**
```json
"scope": ["pcfra", "peep", "rpeep", "ees_person_statement", "share_with_frs"]
```
Consent for everything needed for RPEEP compliance.

**Partial consent (given for PEEP, refused for FRS sharing):**

First record (given):
```json
{
  "state": "given",
  "scope": ["pcfra", "peep", "rpeep"]
}
```

Second record (refused):
```json
{
  "state": "refused",
  "scope": ["share_with_frs"]
}
```

**Scope meanings:**

**`"pcfra"`:**  
Consent for Person-Centred Fire Risk Assessment.  
Needed to: assess functional capability, environmental risks.

**`"peep"`:**  
Consent for Personal Emergency Evacuation Plan.  
Needed to: create evacuation plan based on PCFRA.

**`"rpeep"`:**  
Consent specifically for Residential PEEP (UK Residential Regs 2025).  
Needed in: UK residential buildings from April 2026.

**`"ees_person_statement"`:**  
Consent for EES Personal (plain-language evacuation instructions).  
Needed to: provide resident-facing instructions (UK Reg 10).

**`"share_with_frs"`:**  
Consent to share PEEP with Fire and Rescue Service.  
Needed for: FRS access to plans (UK Reg 12).

**Common mistakes:**
- ‚ùå Empty array: `"scope": []` (must have at least 1)
- ‚ùå Misspelled: `"scope": ["peep_plan"]` (not in enum)
- ‚ùå Too broad: Can't consent to "everything" generically
- ‚úÖ Specific, enumerated purposes

**Legal significance:**  
If you process data beyond the consented scope, you're in breach.

## Core vs Extensions Pattern

### Consent Schema is Fully Portable

The Consent schema **doesn't need extensions** for most jurisdictions.

Why? Because consent concepts are universal:
- ‚úÖ Given/refused/withdrawn - same everywhere
- ‚úÖ Timestamp, method, scope - same everywhere
- ‚úÖ Lawful basis for data processing - global concept

### When You Might Use Extensions

**Jurisdiction-specific consent requirements:**

**UK (gbr):**
```json
"extensions": {
  "gbr": {
    "residentialRegs2025Compliant": true,
    "informationDutyFulfilled": true
  }
}
```

**EU (eu):**
```json
"extensions": {
  "eu": {
    "gdprArticle6Basis": "consent",
    "gdprArticle9Basis": "explicit_consent"
  }
}
```

**USA (usa):**
```json
"extensions": {
  "usa": {
    "hipaaApplicable": false,
    "ccpaOptOutOffered": true
  }
}
```

### But Usually Not Needed

For 95% of use cases, core Consent schema is sufficient.

## Jurisdiction Profiles

### UK Profile

**UK Residential Regs 2025 Requirements:**

**Reg 4:** Must offer and record consent for RPEEP.

**Compliant consent record:**
```json
{
  "state": "given",
  "capturedAt": "2025-10-14T10:00:00Z",
  "capturedBy": "housing.officer@example.org",
  "scope": ["pcfra", "peep", "rpeep", "ees_person_statement", "share_with_frs"],
  "method": "written",
  "evidenceRef": "https://example.org/consent-form.pdf",
  "offerMadeAt": "2025-10-14T09:30:00Z",
  "personRef": "person-uuid-001"
}
```

**Key points:**
- ‚úÖ Must offer (record `offerMadeAt`)
- ‚úÖ Must record decision (even if refused)
- ‚úÖ Scope includes `"rpeep"` and `"share_with_frs"` (Reg 12)
- ‚úÖ Method documented (evidence trail)

**Refusal handling:**
```json
{
  "state": "refused",
  "capturedAt": "2025-10-14T10:00:00Z",
  "capturedBy": "housing.officer@example.org",
  "scope": ["pcfra", "peep", "rpeep"],
  "method": "verbal",
  "reason": "Prefers to manage own evacuation",
  "offerMadeAt": "2025-10-14T09:30:00Z",
  "notes": "Resident politely declined. Explained benefits; confirmed understanding. Offered to reconsider any time. Will re-offer at annual review."
}
```

**Compliance:** Duty holder has offered consent and recorded refusal. ‚úÖ

### EU Profile

**GDPR Requirements:**

**Article 7:** Consent must be:
- Freely given
- Specific
- Informed
- Unambiguous

**Compliant consent:**
```json
{
  "state": "given",
  "capturedAt": "2025-10-14T10:00:00Z",
  "capturedBy": "data.processor@example.eu",
  "scope": ["pcfra", "peep"],
  "method": "written",
  "notes": "Consent form provided in resident's language (German). GDPR information notice provided. Resident confirmed understanding before signing.",
  "validFrom": "2025-10-14T10:00:00Z"
}
```

**Key GDPR points:**
- ‚úÖ Specific scope (not blanket consent)
- ‚úÖ Informed (information notice provided)
- ‚úÖ Unambiguous (written, signed)
- ‚úÖ Can be withdrawn (right under Article 7(3))

**Withdrawal:**
```json
{
  "state": "withdrawn",
  "capturedAt": "2025-11-01T14:00:00Z",
  "capturedBy": "data.processor@example.eu",
  "scope": ["share_with_frs"],
  "method": "written",
  "validUntil": "2025-11-01T14:00:00Z",
  "notes": "Resident exercised right to withdraw consent under GDPR Article 7(3). Processing ceased immediately."
}
```

---

### USA Profile

**Generally:** Consent less emphasized (no equivalent to GDPR consent requirements).

**ADA/OSHA:** Employer has legal duty (not consent-based).

**CCPA (California):** Right to opt out of data sharing.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "state": "given",
  "capturedAt": "2025-10-14T10:00:00Z",
  "capturedBy": "safety.officer@example.com",
  "scope": ["pcfra", "peep"],
  "method": "written",
  "notes": "Employee provided consent as part of workplace accommodation process (ADA). CCPA privacy notice provided; opt-out option offered."
}
```

## Consent Lifecycle

### Flow 1: Given ‚Üí Still Active

```
1. Offer made (offerMadeAt)
2. Consent given (state: "given", capturedAt)
3. PCFRA created
4. PEEP created
5. EES delivered
6. Annual review ‚Üí consent still valid
```

**Consent record:**
```json
{
  "state": "given",
  "offerMadeAt": "2025-01-15T09:00:00Z",
  "capturedAt": "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z",
  "scope": ["pcfra", "peep", "rpeep", "share_with_frs"],
  "validFrom": "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z"
}
```

### Flow 2: Refused ‚Üí Re-offered ‚Üí Given

```
1. Offer made (2025-01-15)
2. Consent refused (state: "refused")
3. [Time passes]
4. Re-offer made (2026-01-20, annual review)
5. Consent given (state: "given")
```

**First record (refused):**
```json
{
  "state": "refused",
  "offerMadeAt": "2025-01-15T09:00:00Z",
  "capturedAt": "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z",
  "scope": ["pcfra", "peep"],
  "reason": "Not ready to participate"
}
```

**Second record (given, later):**
```json
{
  "state": "given",
  "offerMadeAt": "2026-01-20T09:00:00Z",
  "capturedAt": "2026-01-20T10:30:00Z",
  "scope": ["pcfra", "peep", "rpeep"],
  "notes": "Resident reconsidered at annual review. Confirmed willing to participate."
}
```

### Flow 3: Given ‚Üí Withdrawn (Partial)

```
1. Consent given for: PCFRA, PEEP, share with FRS
2. [Time passes]
3. Resident withdraws consent for: share with FRS (but keeps PEEP consent)
```

**Original consent:**
```json
{
  "state": "given",
  "capturedAt": "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z",
  "scope": ["pcfra", "peep", "share_with_frs"]
}
```

**Withdrawal (partial):**
```json
{
  "state": "withdrawn",
  "capturedAt": "2025-06-20T14:00:00Z",
  "scope": ["share_with_frs"],
  "validUntil": "2025-06-20T14:00:00Z",
  "reason": "Privacy concerns; no longer wishes to share with FRS"
}
```

**Result:** PCFRA and PEEP consent still valid. FRS sharing consent withdrawn.

## FAQs

### Q: Do I need separate consent for PCFRA and PEEP?

**A:** No, one consent can cover both. Use `scope`:
```json
"scope": ["pcfra", "peep"]
```

### Q: What if person consents to PCFRA but refuses PEEP?

**A:** Two separate records:

Consent for PCFRA:
```json
{
  "state": "given",
  "scope": ["pcfra"]
}
```

Refusal for PEEP:
```json
{
  "state": "refused",
  "scope": ["peep"]
}
```

### Q: How long do I keep consent records?

**A:** UK guidance:
- **Active consent:** For life of PCFRA/PEEP
- **Refused consent:** 6 years (evidence you offered)
- **Withdrawn consent:** 6 years after withdrawal

### Q: Can I assume consent if they don't respond?

**A:** ‚ùå **No!** Silence is not consent.

Must have explicit action:
- ‚úÖ Signed form
- ‚úÖ Verbal "yes" (recorded)
- ‚úÖ Ticked box
- ‚ùå Didn't respond
- ‚ùå Didn't say no

### Q: Is workplace PEEP consent-based?

**A:** Usually no. Employer has **legal duty** (FSO 2005, not consent).

But good practice: offer consent anyway (respectful, good evidence).

### Q: What if family member gives consent on their behalf?

**A:** Depends on capacity:

- **Person has capacity:** Only they can consent
- **Person lacks capacity:** Authorized representative can consent (under relevant law - Mental Capacity Act 2005 in UK)

Record in `notes`:
```json
"notes": "Consent given by authorized representative (Power of Attorney) due to resident's lack of capacity. Legal authorization verified."
```
