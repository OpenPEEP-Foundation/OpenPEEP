# OpenPEEP Concept Guide

**Understanding the Standard That Changes Everything**

**Purpose:** A 5-minute introduction for stakeholders who need to understand OpenPEEP's significance before diving into technical details  
**Audience:** Housing managers, fire officers, local authority staff, care providers  
**Goal:** Explain open source, standards, and why OpenPEEP changes everything — in simple terms anyone can understand

---

## Introduction

**This guide explains OpenPEEP in simple terms.**

No technical jargon. No complex concepts. Just the essential understanding you need to appreciate why this matters.

**If you're an expert in fire safety, housing management, or care provision, but new to software standards and open source — this guide is for you.**

You already understand the problem. This guide explains the solution.

## The Problem We All Know

**After Grenfell, we learned something terrible.**

When vulnerable residents need to evacuate — wheelchair users, elderly people, disabled residents — we don't have the information we need to help them safely.

**72 people died. And we learned that evacuation planning was completely fragmented.**

### What This Means in Practice

**Here's what happens right now:**

- **Housing Provider A** creates evacuation plans (PEEPs) using System X
- **Housing Provider B** creates PEEPs using System Y  
- **Care Home C** creates PEEPs using System Z

**When Fire & Rescue Services attend an incident, they can't access that information.**

They don't know:
- Who needs help
- Where they are
- What equipment they need
- How to assist them safely

**It's like every housing provider speaks a different language, and Fire Services need a different translator for each one.**

That's not just inefficient — that's dangerous.

## What the Government Said vs What Nobody Provided

### The Government Told You WHAT to Do

**Fire Safety (Residential Evacuation Plans) (England) Regulations 2025:**

✅ **Assess** evacuation capability of relevant residents  
✅ **Create** Personal Emergency Evacuation Plans (PEEPs)  
✅ **Obtain consent** for information sharing  
✅ **Share** PEEPs with Fire & Rescue Services  
✅ **Review** plans annually  

**The government said WHAT you need to do.**

### But Nobody Told You HOW to Do It

**Until OpenPEEP, nobody provided:**
- ❌ **Standard format** for structuring PEEP information
- ❌ **Standard way** to share data with Fire Services
- ❌ **Standard approach** to storing and managing PEEPs
- ❌ **Standard method** for transferring PEEPs between organizations

**Everyone was left to figure out HOW on their own.**

### The Result

**Without guidance on HOW:**
- **170 local authorities** each creating their own approach
- **Proprietary systems** that don't talk to each other
- **Fragmented data** that Fire Services can't access
- **Expensive integrations** to make systems work together

**Chaos, duplication, and inefficiency.**

## The Solution: THE Language

**We've created THE language that everyone can speak.**

### Important Distinction

**OpenPEEP is NOT:**
- ❌ **Software that creates PEEPs** (doesn't do the work for you)
- ❌ **A system that solves the problem** (doesn't replace your processes)
- ❌ **A tool that generates evacuation plans** (you still need to do the planning)

**OpenPEEP IS:**
- ✅ **THE language** that everyone speaks
- ✅ **THE standard** for how to structure and communicate PEEP information
- ✅ **THE format** that everyone can understand

### The Language Analogy

**Current situation:**
- **Your housing provider** speaks French (proprietary PEEP format)
- **Your Fire Service** speaks German (different proprietary format)
- **Your care home** speaks Spanish (another proprietary format)

**Result:** You need expensive universal translators (custom integrations) to make them talk to each other.

**With OpenPEEP:**
- **Everyone speaks English** (the OpenPEEP standard format)
- **No translators needed** (universal compatibility)
- **Everyone understands each other** (seamless communication)

### What You Still Need to Do

**You still need to:**
- ✅ **Create the PEEPs** (do the evacuation planning)
- ✅ **Assess residents** (understand their needs)
- ✅ **Design evacuation routes** (plan the procedures)
- ✅ **Get consent** (legal requirements)
- ✅ **Review annually** (keep plans current)

**OpenPEEP doesn't do any of that for you.**

### What OpenPEEP Provides

**OpenPEEP provides:**
- ✅ **THE language** (how to structure the information)
- ✅ **THE format** (how to communicate the information)
- ✅ **THE standard** (what information is needed)

**It's like having a universal language for fire safety evacuation planning.**

## The Electrical Plug Analogy

**Think about electrical plugs.**

**Before standard plugs:**
- Every device had its own plug shape
- Every country had different outlets
- Travel was a nightmare
- Expensive adapters everywhere

**After standard plugs:**
- **THE standard plug shape** (every device uses it)
- **THE standard outlet** (every building has outlets for it)
- **Universal compatibility** — everything works together
- **Anyone can build devices** — they just use the standard plug

**That's what we've done for fire safety evacuation planning.**

## Open Source Explained

### What "Open Source" Means

**"Open source" sounds technical, but it's simple:**

- **Free to use** — no licensing fees, ever
- **Free to adapt** — modify for your needs
- **Free to share** — distribute to others
- **No one owns it** — it belongs to everyone

**Like the electrical plug standard — no one owns it, everyone uses it, and it makes everything work together.**

### Why This Matters

**Traditional approach:**
- Proprietary systems cost £8,000-50,000 per year
- Vendor lock-in — can't switch systems
- No interoperability — systems don't talk to each other

**OpenPEEP approach:**
- **Standard is free** — no licensing fees
- **Multiple vendors** — competition and choice
- **Universal compatibility** — everything works together

---

## The Inevitability

**Once THE standard exists, everything changes.**

**Historical examples:**
- **Electrical plugs** — universal compatibility
- **PDF documents** — everyone can read them
- **HTTP web pages** — every browser works
- **Metric system** — international standard

**OpenPEEP follows the same pattern:**
- **THE standard** for fire safety evacuation planning
- **Universal adoption** — everyone uses it
- **Market transformation** — competition, innovation, choice

### Why Standards Win

**Adoption happens in phases:**

**Phase 1: Early adopters** (3-5 local authorities, 2-3 software vendors)  
**Phase 2: Rapid adoption** (25-50% of authorities, 5-10 vendors)  
**Phase 3: Universal adoption** (80%+ of authorities, 10+ vendors)

**Once Phase 2 begins, Phase 3 becomes inevitable.**

**Like electrical plugs — once enough devices use the standard plug, every new device must use it too.**

## What This Means for You

**The government told you WHAT to do. OpenPEEP tells you HOW to do it.**

### The Value

**Without OpenPEEP:**
- **Expensive universal translators** (£50-100k per connection)
- **Communication chaos** (10+ different languages)
- **Integration headaches** (custom solutions everywhere)

**With OpenPEEP:**
- **Everyone speaks the same language** (no translators needed)
- **Universal communication** (seamless data exchange)
- **No integration headaches** (standard format works everywhere)

### The Bottom Line

**OpenPEEP is the language, not the conversation.**

**You still need to have the conversation (create the PEEPs).**

**But now everyone speaks the same language (OpenPEEP format).**

## Conclusion

### What We've Built

**We've created THE standard that every fire safety evacuation system will be built around.**

**Not a product. Not a service. THE standard.**

**Free. Forever. Universal.**

### What This Changes

**Everything.**

**Just like electrical plugs changed how devices work together, OpenPEEP changes how fire safety systems work together.**

**Universal compatibility. Market competition. Data portability. International adoption.**

### Why This Matters

**The government told you WHAT to do. We've provided the HOW.**

**No more expensive translators. No more communication chaos. No more integration headaches.**

**Everyone speaks the same language.**
