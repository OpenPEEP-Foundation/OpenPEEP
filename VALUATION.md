## What OpenPEEP Delivers

### **For Housing Providers**

**Your challenge:**  
Residential Regs 2025 require PEEPs for vulnerable residents by April 2026. Current market has limited software options, vendor lock-in, and integration challenges.

**OpenPEEP solution:**  
Open data format standard that enables competitive software market and seamless data exchange.

**Your benefits:**

**🎯 Market Choice & Competition:**
- **Multiple software vendors** can build OpenPEEP-compliant solutions
- **Competition drives innovation** and price reduction over time
- **Choose the best solution** for your needs (not limited to one vendor)
- **Vendor lock-in eliminated** — switch software anytime, data travels with you

**🔗 Integration Cost Avoidance:**
- **No custom integrations needed** — standard format works everywhere
- **Share data with Fire Services** without £50-100k integration projects
- **Transfer residents between providers** — PEEP data travels seamlessly
- **Connect with care systems** — standard format enables interoperability

**📋 Procurement Efficiency:**
- **Standard specifications** — "Must support OpenPEEP format"
- **Faster procurement** — competitive tender with standard requirements
- **Lower procurement costs** — £5-20k vs £10-50k for bespoke procurement
- **Reduced vendor risk** — multiple compliant options available

**Real example:**  
Camden Council needs PEEP software for 4,000 high-rise units. With OpenPEEP, they can:
- **Procure from 5+ vendors** (competition) instead of 1-2 (limited choice)
- **Share data with FRS** without £100k integration project (standard format)
- **Switch vendors in future** without losing data (portability)
- **Transfer residents** to other authorities seamlessly (interoperability)

---

### **For Fire & Rescue Services**

**Your challenge:**  
Receiving PEEP data from 50+ housing providers in 10+ different proprietary formats. Can't integrate into operational systems. Can't search or filter data effectively.

**OpenPEEP solution:**  
One standard format. Machine-readable JSON. Structured data you can search, filter, and integrate.

**Your benefits:**

**🔗 Integration Cost Avoidance:**
- **No custom integrations needed** — receive standard format from all providers
- **Plug-and-play integration** — any OpenPEEP-compliant system works
- **Avoid £50-100k integration projects** per housing provider connection
- **Future-proof** — new housing providers automatically compatible

**⚡ Operational Efficiency:**
- **Pre-planning enabled:** Access standardized PEEP data before incidents
- **Faster response:** Know who needs help, where, what equipment (2-5 minutes saved per incident)
- **Training efficiency:** Learn one format, not 10 proprietary systems
- **Operational integration:** Import into MDT, incident management, dispatch systems

**Real impact:**  
Anytown FRS covers 50 buildings across 8 housing providers. Without OpenPEEP:
- **8 different data formats** to integrate (8 × £75k = £600k integration costs)
- **Manual data entry** during incidents (slower response)
- **Training on 8 systems** (higher training costs)

With OpenPEEP:
- **One standard format** from all providers (£0 integration costs)
- **Automated data import** (faster response, better outcomes)
- **One format to learn** (reduced training costs)

---

### **For Local Authorities**

**Your challenge:**  
Overseeing compliance across multiple housing providers. Each using different systems. No coordination possible. Duplicate procurement processes.

**OpenPEEP solution:**  
Adopt one standard across your area. Enable data sharing between providers. Coordinate with FRS using standard format.

**Your benefits:**

**📋 Procurement Efficiency:**
- **Standard specifications** across all housing providers
- **Bulk procurement** — negotiate better rates with vendors
- **Faster procurement cycles** — standard requirements, competitive tender
- **Reduced procurement costs** — £5-20k vs £10-50k per procurement

**🔗 Integration Cost Avoidance:**
- **No custom integrations** between housing providers and FRS
- **Standard data sharing** — residents can transfer between providers
- **Coordination enabled** — share data across your area
- **Future-proof** — new providers automatically compatible

**Real example:**  
Birmingham City Council coordinates 20 housing providers across 15,000 high-rise units. With OpenPEEP:

## Social Value & Fire Safety Impact

### **Fire Safety Context**

**UK fire deaths in dwellings (2022-23):** 236 deaths, 7,196 injuries  
*(Source: Home Office Fire Statistics)*

**Vulnerable groups disproportionately affected:**
- **Older adults (65+):** 40% of fire deaths
- **Disabled persons:** 2-3× higher fire death rate
- **High-rise residents:** Increased risk post-Grenfell

---

### **OpenPEEP's Contribution to Fire Safety**

**How OpenPEEP improves safety:**

✅ **Standardized information:** Fire Services receive consistent, structured PEEP data  
✅ **Pre-planning enabled:** FRS can access resident information before incidents  
✅ **Faster response:** Critical information available during emergency response  
✅ **Equipment tracking:** Know what assistance equipment is available  
✅ **Resident transfers:** Safety information travels when people move buildings  

**Conservative estimate:** If OpenPEEP contributes to preventing **5% of fire deaths** among vulnerable residents:

- **12 lives prevented per year** (England)
- **360 injuries prevented per year**

---

### **Economic Value of Lives Prevented**

**Using HM Treasury's established methodology** for valuing life safety interventions:

**Value of Statistical Life (UK Treasury Green Book):** £2 million per life

**If OpenPEEP contributes to preventing 12 fire-related deaths per year among vulnerable populations** (based on current UK fire statistics showing disproportionate impact on disabled and elderly residents):

**10-year economic value of lives prevented:**  
**12 deaths prevented/year × £2 million × 10 years = £240 million**

---

### **Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs)**

**For injuries prevented:**
- **Injuries prevented:** 360/year
- **Average QALY gain:** 0.1-0.5 per injury prevented
- **NICE threshold:** £20,000-30,000 per QALY

**10-year economic value of injuries prevented:**  
**£7-54 million**

---

### **Total Social Value**

**Economic value of fire safety improvements:**  
**£247-294 million over 10 years**

**Note:** This represents the economic value of preventing fire deaths and injuries among vulnerable residents. The human value of these lives is immeasurable.
